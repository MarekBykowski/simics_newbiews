<p>

</p><p>
This document provides an introduction to the Simics product and some of its features.
Simics is a full-system simulator mainly targeting software development and analysis.
To do so, it provides hardware and software inspection, dynamic system configuration,
hardware modeling tools, scripting, and a rich set of other features. Unlike many other
virtual machine products, Simics does not focus on being a hardware replacement,
although it can be used in that way.
</p><p>
The introduction in this document is in the form of a few short step-by-step tutorials.
These tutorials are based on the command line version of Simics. There is also an
Eclipse GUI for Simics, but Eclipse is not available to all users and it is also planned
to be phased out in favour of a new Simics GUI currently in development.

<p>

</p><p>
Scripts, screen dumps and code fragments are presented in a
<code>monospace</code> font. In screen dumps, user input is always presented in
bold font, as in:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Welcome to the Simics prompt
simics&gt; <b>this is something that you should type</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Artificial line breaks may be introduced to prevent the text from
being too wide. A small arrow pointing down indicates that the
interrupted text continues on the next line:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">This is an artificial <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
line break that should not be there.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
<a name="simics"></a>
<a name="project"></a>
</p><p>
The directory where the Simics Base package or any add-on package 
is installed is referred to as
<code>[simics]</code>, for example when mentioning the
<code>[simics]/RELEASENOTES.html</code> file. In the same way, the shortcut
<code>[project]</code> is used to point at the user's project directory.
</p><p>
<br>
The character "/" is used to separate directories and files, for Linux.
If you are using Windows, you should read the character as "\" instead.

<p>

</p><p>
  This section presents the terminology used throughout Simics documentation.
</p><p>
  </p><div style="text-align: center">
    <img alt="" src="simics_terminology.png">
  </div>
<p>
  The computer that Simics is running on is called the Simics <em>host</em>.
  When the documentation, tutorials, and training materials say "host" or
  "host machine", it means the physical computer running the Simics process.
</p><p>
  The hardware that Simics simulates is called the Simics <em>target
  machine</em>, or the <em>target system</em>.
</p><p>
  Target machines, their settings, etc., are altogether called a Simics
  <em>configuration</em>. Usually they are loaded from <code>.simics</code>
  and <code>.include</code> scripts, but manual tweaks may add to the
  configuration.
</p><p>
  One Simics simulation can contain multiple target machines, for example when
  Simics is simulating a network.
</p><p>
  For interaction with the target system, Simics can present both target
  <em>graphics consoles</em> and target <em>serial consoles</em>.
