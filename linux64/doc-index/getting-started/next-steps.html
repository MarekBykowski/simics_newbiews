This <em>Getting Started</em> document only provides a short introduction of
the Simics product and all its capabilities. Other documents describe the Simics
functionality in more detail. <em>Simics User's Guide</em> covers the basic
feature set of the product. <em>Analyzer User's Guide</em> describes the tools
used for software debugging and analysis. Similarly, the <em>Model Builder
User's Guide</em> covers model development and configuration for Simics. There
are also reference manuals that provide details on commands, interfaces and API
functions.
</p><p>
To access the documentation run the <code>documentation.bat</code> (<code>documentation</code> on Linux) script in your Simics project.
The script will index all the documents for the packages associated with your project, and then it will open the documentation in your webbrowser.

Simics provides a few commands that assist in exploring large
simulated systems, and for exploring the CLI.
</p><p>
Such a command is <b>help</b>. Use it to receive help about almost
anything in Simics that has a name, in particular the commands you
have seen in this document, and which you will see in the rest of the
Simics documentation.
</p><p>
Another important command is <b>help-search</b>, also
known as <b>apropos</b>. It can be used to search the
Simics reference documentation for a particular text string.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Both <b>help</b> and <b>apropos</b> limit their search to
documentation about everything that is currently loaded into
Simics. This means it is usually best to run them after you have
loaded the target system you want to explore.
</div>A simulation in Simics is built from objects. Each object provides
local (or <em>namespaced</em>) commands. Different kinds of objects
provides different namespaced commands.
<p>
Sometimes you know of an interesting namespaced command you want to
use, for example the <b>enable-tracker</b> command, but you don't know which
objects provide the command. To find those objects, first use
the <b>apropos</b> command to find which kinds of objects that provide
the command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>apropos enable-tracker</b>
The text 'enable-tracker' appears in the documentation
for the following items:

Command        &lt;os_awareness&gt;.disable-tracker
Command        &lt;os_awareness&gt;.enable-tracker
</pre><p>
</p><p>
You can see that the command is provided
by the <b>os_awareness</b> objects. To find such objects in the
target system, use <b>list-objects</b>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>list-objects -all class = os_awareness</b>
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│    Class     │    Object    │
├──────────────┼──────────────┤
│&lt;os_awareness&gt;│board.software│
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Evidently, the only <b>os_awareness</b> object in the target system
is <b>board.software</b>.
</p><p>
Note the use of the <i>-all</i> flag to
make <b>list-objects</b> list all matching objects. Without it,
the command only lists objects in the current namespace. In Simics,
certain objects called components contain other objects and form a
local namespace. In this case <b>board</b>
contains <b>board.software</b>.
</p><p>
These simple commands goes a long way when you want to explore more of
Simics yourself.
